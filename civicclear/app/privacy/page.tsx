      <LegalSection title="Who we are">
        <p>
          CampusClean is a campus issue reporting platform that helps students
          submit reports (such as waterlogging, elevators, escalators, and
          washrooms) and helps coordinators verify and resolve them. This policy
          explains what information we collect and how we use it.

      <LegalSection title="Information we collect">
        <p>Depending on how you use CampusClean, we may collect:</p>

          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-ink">Account details</strong>{" "}

            <strong className="font-semibold text-ink">Report content</strong>{" "}
            — titles, descriptions, issue type, photos, campus location, and
            status history.

          <li>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-ink">Reward activity</strong>{" "}

        <ul>
          <li>To create and manage your account.</li>
          <li>
            To investigate, assign, and resolve campus reports you submit.

          <li>
            To award points when a coordinator verifies (and optionally resolves)
            a valid report.

      <LegalSection title="Photos and campus location">
        <p>
          Photos and campus locations you attach to a report are used only to
          investigate that issue. Coordinators can see them while handling the
          report. Public marketing pages do not list your personal reports or
          contact details.

      <LegalSection title="Retention">
        <p>
          We keep account and complaint records for as long as needed to
          operate the service, meet departmental record-keeping needs, and
          handle disputes. You may request correction of inaccurate profile
          details from your profile page, or ask for account deletion by
          contacting the department that operates your CampusClean instance.

        <p>
          Passwords are hashed. Optional Aadhaar values are hashed before
          storage. Sessions use secure cookies. Uploaded images are checked for
          allowed types and size. No method of transmission or storage is
          perfectly secure; we take reasonable steps to protect your data.

          date at the top of this page will change when we do. Continued use
